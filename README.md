# ðŸ§® React Math Router App

A simple React application to practice routing using `react-router-dom`. The app features a sidebar with three mathematical operations: **Addition**, **Subtraction**, and **Multiplication**. Users can input two numbers and perform calculations, with results dynamically shown based on URL path parameters.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The React Math Router App is designed to help developers practice routing in React using `react-router-dom`. The app allows users to perform basic mathematical operations by navigating to different routes that include the operation type and the numbers involved in the calculation.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses path parameters to perform operations and display results.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Easy navigation between different operations.
- **Interactive Form**: Users can input numbers and see results immediately after submitting the form.
- **Error Handling**: Basic handling for invalid routes.
- **Responsive Design**: Simple and responsive design for a better user experience.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: Routing library for React.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for logic and functionality.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can verify this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otsembo/math-buddy.git
   cd math-buddy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸŽ® Usage

### Navigating the App

- **Sidebar**: Click on any operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication) to start.
- **Input Form**: Enter two numbers and click "Calculate".
- **Result**: The result will be displayed along with the updated URL reflecting the operation and numbers.

### URL Paths

The app uses the following path structure for routing:

- `/addition`: Navigate to the addition form.
- `/subtraction`: Navigate to the subtraction form.
- `/multiplication`: Navigate to the multiplication form.
- `/:operation/:num1/:num2`: Display the result of the operation.

You can also manually enter a URL to see the result for different numbers.

### Example URLs

- **Addition**: `/addition/5/3`
- **Subtraction**: `/subtraction/10/4`
- **Multiplication**: `/multiplication/7/6`

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- **Division Operation**: Add a division operation with error handling for division by zero.
- **Input Validation**: Improve validation for edge cases (e.g., negative numbers).
- **User Authentication**: Add user login and history tracking for personalized experience.
- **Styling**: Incorporate CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for improved UI.
